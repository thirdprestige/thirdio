    <h1 id='using_technology_to_train_technologists'>Using Technology to Train Technologists</h1>
    
    <h2 id='registration'>Registration</h2>
    
    <p>Technology isn&#8217;t just in use during the training. It comes into play before I&#8217;m even on-site. The registration experience is key. (It&#8217;s also not a givenâ€”often the contracts are with corporations, so unless I push for each trainee to register individually, all I know is &#8220;20 trainees&#8221; instead of about each trainee. This isn&#8217;t the case when hosting public classes, of course.)</p>
    
    <p>By requiring each trainee to register, I&#8217;m able to:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Ask them questions upfront about their skill level, giving me a feel for the overall class profile. More senior developers? Push through the easier stuff, faster. Mostly junior developers? Maybe I need to add more examples and exercises to the curriculum. Sometimes, I see a lot of junior developers with a few grizzled neckbeards thrown in, and I know to make friends with the experienced developers, maybe find some of their projects online beforehand, so I can rely on them to help me out when the more junior developers get stuck.</li>
    
    <li>Email updated prework, as I&#8217;ll have their email address.</li>
    
    <li>Help out any trainees who are having trouble with the prework. (The last thing you want is the first morning to be spent helping that guy who has a Windows machine install Ruby, while everyone else waits, bored out of their minds.)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id='packing_list'>Packing list</h2>
    
    <p>Before I jump on the plane to the training, there are a few things I&#8217;ve found indispensable.</p>
    
    <h3 id='two_macbooks'>Two MacBooks</h3>
    
    <p>Two? Yes, two MacBooks. :) I use one for trainee-facing material: slides, interactive coding exercises, code examples. But to keep the flow of the class clean, I also have another one for my own use: Googling answers to trainee questions, responding to the class chatroom, or checking email during class breaks.</p>
    
    <p>(Also, several chargers&#8212;both in case you lose one, and in case a trainee forgets his for the day, you aren&#8217;t left short.)</p>
    
    <h3 id='a_projector'>A Projector</h3>
    
    <p>Clients are usually willing to provide projectors, but there&#8217;s always the connector problem, and of course it can be a pain to arrange beforehand. This one is reasonably affordable and portable, and I always know I&#8217;ll have what I need.</p>
    
    <h3 id='apple_tv_and_an_hdmi_cable'>Apple TV and an HDMI cable</h3>
    
    <p>I&#8217;ve been in situations where there were conference room TVs, but they were far from my desk/the center of the room. A lot of times they are spread around the room, and it&#8217;s nicer to use the TVs than a projector because you can see what&#8217;s going on from all around the room. And an Apple TV lets me hook up to the display wirelessly, so I&#8217;m ready for any room layout imaginable.</p>
    
    <p>I can also let trainees (the ones with MacBooks, anyway) throw their projects up onto the screen and show them off.</p>
    
    <h3 id='dry_erase_markers'>Dry erase markers</h3>
    
    <p>You&#8217;ll only be able to use these if they have whiteboards, of course, but even if the training site has whiteboards, often their markers are dried up. I always have my own.</p>
    
    <h2 id='software'>Software</h2>
    
    <h3 id='screensharing_software_like_joinme'>Screen-sharing software (like Join.me)</h3>
    
    <p>Viewing code over a projector or conference room TV can be really difficult. I&#8217;ll always also share my screen over Join.me, so trainees can keep it running in the background and tab over if they need to see something up close.</p>
    
    <h3 id='hipchat'>Hipchat</h3>
    
    <p>This one took me way too long to think of, but it makes a big difference. Some developers are fairly introverted, and are more inclined to ask questions asynchronously. Also, I&#8217;m able to paste links, code examples, or ad-hoc exercises in, and they can copy and paste them in.</p>
    
    <p>Tip: Archive the chat history and send it in your post-training recap.</p>
    
    <h3 id='caffeine_for_os_x'>Caffeine (for OS X)</h3>
    
    <p>The last thing you want is your computer going to sleep in betwee slides. <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caffeine/id411246225?mt=12'>Caffeine</a> takes care of that, all for $0.99.</p>
