# Using Technology to Train Technologists

## Registration

Technology isn't just in use during the training. It comes into play before I'm even on-site. The registration experience is key. (It's also not a givenâ€”often the contracts are with corporations, so unless I push for each trainee to register individually, all I know is "20 trainees" instead of about each trainee. This isn't the case when hosting public classes, of course.) 

By requiring each trainee to register, I'm able to:

* Ask them questions upfront about their skill level, giving me a feel for the overall class profile.  More senior developers? Push through the easier stuff, faster. Mostly junior developers? Maybe I need to add more examples and exercises to the curriculum. Sometimes, I see a lot of junior developers with a few grizzled neckbeards thrown in, and I know to make friends with the experienced developers, maybe find some of their projects online beforehand, so I can rely on them to help me out when the more junior developers get stuck.
* Email updated prework, as I'll have their email address.
* Help out any trainees who are having trouble with the prework. (The last thing you want is the first morning to be spent helping that guy who has a Windows machine install Ruby, while everyone else waits, bored out of their minds.)

## Packing list

Before I jump on the plane to the training, there are a few things I've found indispensable.

### Two MacBooks

Two? Yes, two MacBooks. :) I use one for trainee-facing material: slides, interactive coding exercises, code examples. But to keep the flow of the class clean, I also have another one for my own use: Googling answers to trainee questions, responding to the class chatroom, or checking email during class breaks.

(Also, several chargers&mdash;both in case you lose one, and in case a trainee forgets his for the day, you aren't left short.)

### A Projector

Clients are usually willing to provide projectors, but there's always the connector problem, and of course it can be a pain to arrange beforehand. This one is reasonably affordable and portable, and I always know I'll have what I need.

### Apple TV and an HDMI cable

I've been in situations where there were conference room TVs, but they were far from my desk/the center of the room. A lot of times they are spread around the room, and it's nicer to use the TVs than a projector because you can see what's going on from all around the room. And an Apple TV lets me hook up to the display wirelessly, so I'm ready for any room layout imaginable. 

I can also let trainees (the ones with MacBooks, anyway) throw their projects up onto the screen and show them off.

### Dry erase markers

You'll only be able to use these if they have whiteboards, of course, but even if the training site has whiteboards, often their markers are dried up. I always have my own.


## Software

### Screen-sharing software (like Join.me)

Viewing code over a projector or conference room TV can be really difficult. I'll always also share my screen over Join.me, so trainees can keep it running in the background and tab over if they need to see something up close.

### Hipchat

This one took me way too long to think of, but it makes a big difference. Some developers are fairly introverted, and are more inclined to ask questions asynchronously. Also, I'm able to paste links, code examples, or ad-hoc exercises in, and they can copy and paste them in.

Tip: Archive the chat history and send it in your post-training recap.

### Caffeine (for OS X)

The last thing you want is your computer going to sleep in betwee slides. [Caffeine](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caffeine/id411246225?mt=12) takes care of that,  all for $0.99.
